<!--            <p>Thanks for using DiversePro. This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to your use and accessing of DiversePro’s websites, products, apps, and services-->
<!--                (collectively, the “Services”). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision-->
<!--                about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any-->
<!--                part of this Policy, then you should stop using or accessing the Services.</p>-->
<!--            <p>Use or accessing the Services indicates your agreement to be bound by the Policy and DiversePro’s Terms of Use which is fully incorporated here.</p>-->
<!--            <p>What information do we collect?</p>-->
<!--            <h3>1. Usage/log information</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We collect usage information when you use the Services.-->
<!--                This includes information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, location, operating system and browser type, the address of a-->
<!--                referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and-->
<!--                the amount of time you spend on particular pages, and similar functions or activity.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>2. Cookies and online advertising</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We may also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of “cookies” and similar tracking technologies.-->
<!--                Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user’s computer or device at the request of a website to enable-->
<!--                the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish-->
<!--                to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or “help screen” to learn about-->
<!--                these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able-->
<!--                to use certain parts of the Services.</p>-->
<!--            <p>We may also use third parties to display and target ads, provide certain functionality (such as maps), or to place their-->
<!--                own cookies and other tracking technologies to collect, track and analyze usage and statistical information from users.-->
<!--                We are not responsible for the information collection practices of any third parties.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>3. Personal information</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We collect and store personal information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. This includes-->
<!--                your name, address, location, demographic information, telephone number, email address, or account numbers associated-->
<!--                with your payment method such as credit or debit card. We collect your personal information when you (a) claim, create,-->
<!--                or update your profile, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) use or access the website, its content,-->
<!--                or the Services, or (e) contact a lawyer or share a lawyer’s information. If you are a lawyer and claim, create, or update-->
<!--                your profile, or post information using your profile, we may also collect information related to that activity.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>4. Publicly posted Information</h3>-->
<!--            <p>Personal information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your profile may become publicly available-->
<!--                and may no longer be considered personal information. For example, information you post in your profile may be made-->
<!--                publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes-->
<!--                consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated,-->
<!--                including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).</p>-->
<!--            <p>How we use the information we collect</p>-->
<!--            <h3>1. Non-personal information</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We use information other than personal information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for-->
<!--                general marketing activity, remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer-->
<!--                the Services, improve customer service, and diagnose problems with our servers. Third party ad platforms may use-->
<!--                this information for a similar purpose. We may publish, disclose and use aggregated or anonymized information to or with third parties.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>2. Personal information</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We use personal information to facilitate your use of the Services, to improve the Services, to process your requests or-->
<!--                transactions, to provide you with information and services, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business,-->
<!--                and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant-->
<!--                to you. We may also send you advertisements from third parties.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>3. Third-party service providers</h3>-->
<!--            <p>If we engage with our affiliates or third-party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share personal information-->
<!--                with such affiliate or service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may-->
<!--                use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information, to verify your identity, or to improve aspects of our business.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>4. Text messaging</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number,-->
<!--                you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number, and waive any rights you may have under the Telephone Consumer-->
<!--                Protection Act. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.</p>-->

<!--            <h3>Managing your preferences</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to-->
<!--                manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by us. Additionally, and because data acquired across the-->
<!--                internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising-->
<!--                preferences via: Google Ad Preferences Manager, Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, Facebook Ad Preferences Manager,-->
<!--                Network Advertising Initiative, and Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply-->
<!--                with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our-->
<!--                other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect-->
<!--                our or our users’ rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful-->
<!--                use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical-->
<!--                injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of personal information.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>-->
<!--            <p>Lawyers may change content they create on their profile by claiming their profile and editing the information contained in it.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>Security measures</h3>-->
<!--            <p>We endeavor to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place-->
<!--                reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example,-->
<!--                when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software-->
<!--                and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally,-->
<!--                your account information is password-protected.</p>-->
<!--            <p>No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information,-->
<!--                you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all-->
<!--                use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by contacting us <a href="contact.html">here</a> if you believe your password has been misused.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>Third-party websites and practices</h3>-->
<!--            <p>The Services may contain links to other websites or make available third-party services, including ad platforms and technologies.-->
<!--                We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy-->
<!--                policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another-->
<!--                website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the-->
<!--                originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>Transfers of information</h3>-->
<!--            <p>Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition,-->
<!--                debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in-->
<!--                which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>-->
<!--            <h3>Children</h3>-->
<!--            <p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of Use.-->
<!--                We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided-->
