<!--                <h3>1. Using our Services</h3>-->
<!--                <p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with DiversePro.-->
<!--                    No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their state-->

<!--                    If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity or person, then you agree to the-->
<!--                    Terms and Privacy Policy both for yourself and that entity or person.</p>-->
<!--                <p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services-->
<!--                    or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance-->
<!--                    with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain express written permission-->
<!--                    from DiversePro or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any-->
<!--                    branding or logos used or displayed in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, alter, or attempt to modify-->
<!--                    any branding, logos, or legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>-->
<!--                <h3>2. Information on the Services</h3>-->
<!--                <p>Our Services display both DiversePro-created content and content that is not created-->
<!--                    by DiversePro (collectively, the “Website Content”). We do not screen or verify third-party-->
<!--                    content that is posted via our Services. This includes Website Content that lawyers post on-->
<!--                    DiversePro (defined below as “Lawyer Service Content”), and we do not guarantee the accuracy,-->
<!--                    adequacy, or quality of such information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>-->
<!--                <h3>3. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>-->
<!--                <p>The Website Content found on DiversePro is intended for general informational purposes only-->
<!--                    and should be used only as a starting point for finding or evaluating a lawyer. The Website-->
<!--                    Content is not an agreement for legal services nor is it the provision of legal services.-->
<!--                    Accessing the Website Content, or corresponding with a lawyer via the Services or otherwise-->
<!--                    using the Services or accessing the Website Content, does not in any way create an attorney-client-->
<!--                    relationship between you and DiversePro, or between you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for-->
<!--                    an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about-->
<!--                    your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Website Content.  DiversePro is not a law-->
<!--                    firm and does not provide legal services. You agree that none of the information you provide while-->
<!--                    using the Services is confidential or subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>-->
<!--                <h3>4. Legal services for consumers</h3>-->
<!--                <p>DiversePro is a directory platform where consumers can find and contact lawyers who are-->
<!--                    unaffiliated with DiversePro. DiversePro has no legal obligation or duty to you or to any-->
<!--                    lawyer on the website.  You agree that DiversePro cannot be held responsible for the quality-->
<!--                    or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you find using the website.</p>-->
<!--                <h3>5. Additional services for lawyers</h3>-->
<!--                <p>DiversePro offers optional services to lawyers as part of subscriptions (collectively,-->
<!--                    the “Lawyer Service”). By using a Lawyer Service, you agree to pay DiversePro the-->
<!--                    subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services-->
<!--                    will be charged on the day your Lawyer Service goes into effect and will cover the use of-->
<!--                    that service for the period indicated.  Thereafter, you agree that payments will continue-->
<!--                    to be charged on a recurring basis, to be automatically renewed at the end of the service-->
<!--                    period, until you cancel your Lawyer Service. The amount of the Lawyer Service will be the-->
<!--                    then-current subscription fee applicable to the Lawyer Service you selected. You acknowledge-->
<!--                    that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases.-->
<!--                    The Lawyer Service must be cancelled prior to your renewal in order to avoid billing of the next-->
<!--                    period’s Lawyer Service fee. All cancellations must be received by submitted a request <a href="contact.html">here</a>. Lawyer-->
<!--                    Service fees are not prorated or refundable.</p>-->
<!--                <p>If your payment method fails or your account is past due, DiversePro reserves the-->
<!--                right to either suspend or terminate your Lawyer Service. Any such suspension or termination-->
<!--                will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Lawyer Service.-->
<!--                You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to DiversePro-->
<!--                within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute shall be waived, and such charge-->
<!--                will be final and not subject to challenge. If your account is cancelled, suspended, or terminated,-->
<!--                we may in our sole discretion convert your account to the level associated with an unclaimed,-->
<!--                non-active account.</p>-->
<!--                <p>The Lawyer Service may include the publication of content you provide to DiversePro-->
<!--                or that you otherwise create and post on the website (the “Lawyer Service Content”).-->
<!--                You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Lawyer Service Content.-->

<!--                transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display,-->
<!--                reproduce, and distribute the Lawyer Service Content (in whole or in part) in providing the-->
<!--                Services. You agree that DiversePro may in its sole discretion remove or refuse to display-->
<!--                all or any part of the Lawyer Service Content for any reason.</p>-->
<!--                <p>You agree that the Lawyer Service Content you post on the website or provide to-->
<!--                DiversePro is accurate, is not in any way misleading, and complies with all applicable-->
<!--                legal and ethical obligations, including compliance with lawyer advertising requirements.</p>-->

<!--                    within SIX (6) MONTHS from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it is-->
<!--                    permanently barred. If applicable law prohibits a six-month limitation period-->
<!--                    for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period-->
<!--                    permitted by applicable law.</p>-->
<!--                <p>Whenever feasible, the arbitration will be held telephonically unless the arbitrator-->
<!--                    finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Dallas, Texas shall be the-->
<!--                    sole and exclusive place of arbitration.</p>-->
<!--                <p>The enforcement of the arbitrator’s award will be controlled by and conducted in-->

<!--                    court of competent jurisdiction solely for injunctive relief to stop any unauthorized-->
<!--                    use or abuse of the Services, or any intellectual property infringement. In these instances,-->
<!--                    DiversePro may seek injunctive relief without first engaging in the informal dispute resolution-->
<!--                    or arbitration process, as described above in these Terms.</p>-->
<!--                <p>NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only bring individual claims. Under no circumstances are you allowed-->
<!--                    to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class. Class action lawsuits, class-wide-->
<!--                    arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceedings where someone acts in-->
<!--                    a representative capacity are not allowed. Any combining of individual proceedings must have the-->
<!--                    consent of all parties.</p>-->

<!--                <p>The laws of the State of Texas, excluding its conflict of law provisions, shall apply to-->
<!--                    any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, the Services,-->
<!--                    the Website Content, or the Lawyer Service Content.</p>-->
<!--                <h3>15. Termination</h3>-->
<!--                <p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, DiversePro reserves the right, without notice and in its-->
<!--                    sole discretion, to terminate your use of the Services and to block or prevent your access to-->
<!--                    and use of the Services. DiversePro reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any-->
<!--                    reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason,-->
<!--                    you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via-->
<!--                    the Services, or any other data, and you agree that DiversePro may, at its sole discretion, destroy such data or communications.</p>-->

<!--                <p>DiversePro’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so-->
<!--                    later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the-->
<!--                    Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting-->
<!--                    our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and-->
<!--                    any attempt to do so will be void. DiversePro may, however, assign its rights without notice to or consent by you.</p>-->
